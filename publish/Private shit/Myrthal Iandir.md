# Story


Myrthal Iandir is an winter Eladrin elf who spent the first 50 years of their life perfecting the art of magic. Studying, at UMDA he finished the the general course and nearly finished the second course in the main sector. Eventually they joined a group of wizards in an experiment. Together, they felt that the need for a separate spell-casting focus was inhibiting the ability of wizards, and decided to try implanting parts of a spell-casting focus into Myrthals arm. This was a long and painful process, and their memory of the event is spotty. But the whole thing was quite hush hush and nothing was shared with anyone else except the students participating. To activate the crystals in their arm, a large, powerful magic boost was needed to kick start the arcane focus. This was achieved by channelling a part of the feywild through the spell-casting focus, or at least that's what they think happened. The experiment went wrong, and the only thing they can remember is that their body was dumped and buried underground. Due to this expiriment much of their early memories are foggy and or gone. Myrthal does not remember much about how they grew up or their time studying at UMDA

75 years later, Myrthal awoke on the shore of  the republic of ne with much of their memory gone and a scarred right arm+hand full of blue crystals. They spent their years trying to cast magic again, using only a spell book and scraps they could find. Casting through their arm was impossible, and only resulted in hurting themselves. In order to avoid society as much as possible, Myrthal lived in the woods and communicated with their spell book. After some time coming to terms themselves a little they tried going back into society. 

He tried some dungeneering becoming part of QPD Questing but during their second dungeon he was attacked by a group of people. During this he tried to flee but was cornered. they suddenly magically teleported away up to the top floor of the dungeon and then back down one floor. luckily the random teleportation and clever use of the invisabilty spell were enough to get away safely.  Myrthal suspects it was the group that he worked with at UMDA that want something to do with them. During the fight the assailants did try to capture them but it did not work out.

In the current day, Myrthal is trying to uncover the mysteries of the crystals in their arm and further their knowledge of arcane and the world in general. They are not an experienced fighter, but they have fought some monsters throughout their travels, always trying to learn as much about these creatures as possible and writing their knowledge down in their trusty notebook. They are also a little suspicius and not the biggest fan of going out in public still afraid they would be found by the group following. They do their best to cover their tracks and havent had a confrontation yet.

All things after having woken up have happened in about half a year or 9 months. They are currently not planning to back to UMDA because they are afraid that they will be found by the group following. Unless they really need the information like if the whole world would have gone to shit.

## In play

In play, Myrthal is book smart but not street smart. They are haunted by their past and do not know where they are from. They have not returned to the academy out of fear that the people who did this to them are still alive and have ill intentions. They are a relatively young elf, having just finished the UMDA main sector. They are quite naive, but hoard knowledge on all subjects. Their primary interests are knowledge of their past, where is Myrthal from and who are their parents. What happened during the experiment was it actually the experiment that was said or was it attempting to do something else. And of course furthering the knowledge of the world. Once the Apocalypse happens they will start trying to use magic to manipulate dimensions or find the cause of the apocalypse and then trying to use dunamentic like magic to start manipulating reality and the plains or at least start researching into that topic. Taking more support spells later on to help the party in a more supporting role or go for all out damage still has to be seen and will be decided later in the group.
