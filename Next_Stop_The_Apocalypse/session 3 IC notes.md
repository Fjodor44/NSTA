# session 3 IC notes
With the zeitgeists defeated they did not leave much behind only a belt and some rags. The [[Potentiality Obolisk]] Seemed to have a defence mechanism repelling energy and magic. But it did not emit a trace of magic. It is almost like the spell has a permanent non-detection spell, damage and magical energy seemed to be repelled. Healing energy got absorb and turned the pile to ash. leaving behind only ash and 3 crystals of [[arcane quartz]] of the quality [[Galazar]]. Could my friend [[Lisander Galazar|Lisander]] have connection to the refinement of Galazar and this is the same material als the [[Galazar Blade]] which was the blade used to kill wizards. Furthermore a cracked potentiality shard was left behind in the ash. [[Enoki]] took some of the ash and it might be worth investigating . 
During the night I had an unfamiliar dream of previous memories. [[Myrthal's Memory]]
on the 4th week of travel we where attacked by a [[Tree-ent]] apparently having encroached on its territory. This is a fascination created and I am saddened that we had to kill it. But its bark proved useful because we where able to reinforce the cart with it. The [[Upgrade Ritual]] was a fascinating mix of druidic magic and arcane magic. This costs a lot of magic on my part after which we where surrounded by a group of elven rangers. I fear for my life but I hope the argument of self-defence will work.
