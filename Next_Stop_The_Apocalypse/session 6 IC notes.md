# session 6 IC notes

After Haiden ran back to the [[Qho Prosperity Division|QPD]] to get permission to enter the overgrown aquaduct he had to sign us up as an adventuring party again. The party is now named [[The Dying timeline]] with me as a leader. Apperently a person who wiped his own memory is stable enough to be party leader.
We got more information about our journey for the [[Quest to Kashmir]] We will be stopping over in 2 towns [[Listaar]] and [[Moongrove]] both having their own issues. On [[Hayden]] return to the party we set off to towards the obelisk.

During the travel to the [[Potentiality Obolisk]] most of my time was spent on research on the [[Potentiality Shard]] but as of now its secrets continue to allude me. I did make a connection to [[Hayden]]s magic as it seems to be similar to the magic in the shard.

It turns out salmon hunting using magic still works.

Our attempts to contact [[Dew]] where unsuccessful and came back with a ton of static and I state 'it sounds like a ton of glass shattering and tearing with an underlying sea of screams.' This is seriously concerning and is most likely connected to [[The Collapse]]. Once we have arrived in [[Kashmir]] we need to spent some time investigating this.

On our 5th day of travel we met an old traveling mechant who was selling wierd wares. I bought a dreamcatcher for the Cart and we also bought a diamond for 45 gold which turned out to be worth 315 gold pieces.  Something feels off about the diamonds but it did not give of any magic. 

Arriving at the [[Potentiality Obolisk]] It did not seem to give of any magic two [[Zeitgeist|Zeitgeists]] where protecting the obelisk. During the fight I noticed that Haydens gave off a type of magic am going to call [[Time Magic]] for now this is the same magic that is inside the shard. The Zeitgeists has similar effects but because of their origin which is literally time I did not see any magic coming off of them.
