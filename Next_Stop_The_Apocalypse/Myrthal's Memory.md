# Myrthal's Memory 
 
 Myrthal sitting on a rooftop not alone i am with friend a bald crokscrew horned tiefling purple skin white eyes dressed in magerobes. I am also dressed in mage robes that are unfamiliar but I know they are scholars robes. I am laughing having fun on top of a rooftop. I feel at ease and a sense of calm washes over me. and an intense spark of happyness as a voice goes, tiefling masculin behind me feminen voice behind me gentle and feminen. she calls my name. and I catch a brief glimps of a human women golden blond hair green eyes somewhere in her late 20's this is not a normal human they have something bound to them some spirit is bound to them causing them supernatural abilities and their voice makes me happy I cannot quite make out why. end momory momories of sitting in class fly by magic 101 filled with hope potential and excitment. without any stress. passses. no face is remembered.
