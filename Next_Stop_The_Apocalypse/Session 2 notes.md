info from dew bonedevils are interesting, they are simpler devils medium ranks. they have fast flight and walking speed. impervious to fire and resitance to non magical weapons. they are like a lot of devils and aren't impeded by magical darkness, they are driven by lust & darkness and taskmasters of lesser devils. hate working under people. many stories of bonedevils being tricked into attacking their masters.
