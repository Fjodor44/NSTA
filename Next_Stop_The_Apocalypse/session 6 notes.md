# session 6 notes

# Recap of whole post prologue
coming out of the dying timeline we got jolted into a fucked normal timeline.
we retraced some of our steps and shit went haywire, dew got withdrawn and we went back fought time during the monolith
we decided to go to listar. 
We killed a treeÃ«nt, used it corpse and arrived at the village of lisar.
lisar was a hanging village in the canopy in a redwood forest. here we messed around with the tavern, with a crap load bounty's
include 
arcane abbarations
chemist requires materials
dont on ground at night
local mechrant hunting game
wizard to local grove and warning for goblins.
# Session notes
talia needed an escort to a local grove to harvest magical plants for enchanting danger elementals. 220gp if resistance 280 + bonus for interesting shit.
kitz domain wanted great dear antlers, and each antler is 35gp after that we went to the religuis square and we encountered the ranger commander that rightfully called us asholes
told us to leave some offerings. in hope for good Karma. back to the tavern enoki still sick and at night we saw the real problem of listar. the real reason they where in the air. undead on the ground at night.
Dear to the south. 
enoki is in a cradle of moss and a women sitting on the bed. the spirit weaver sitting on their bed. feywild moonphases are maluable.
the feywild is an inverted sphere and parts are inverted its 4 dimensional. 
the spiritweaver blames themselves but also not themselves.
because the fracture started around enoki. Lesser restoration was cast on myrthal.
above enoki a moss eyeball. moss eyeball called a fey watcher moss on bed is from enoki and then border moss to prevent the spread. 

wizard doesnt like to have his corpses touched.
with a clap two unseen servants go down the staircase. probbably a neclace of unseen servant. 
Fucking corpses
something very fucking fishy.
about 2 hours into the journey haiden spots a small campsite. with smoldering ashes and a hell of a lot of blood. 4 corpses 3 adults and a child mostly merchants and 1 guard. the kills both claw and slash marks. of bladed weapon.  some of the undeads use claws or simple weapons. most likely the merchants got cought up. presonal affects have been there but the backpacks and bedrolls have been stolen. 
tracks around the merchants there where a couple of skeletal feet heading towards the village but they quickly veer off to the left. there is also a drag mark which looks like bags being dragged across the earth. there is a faint magic trace in the scraping of the bag and there was probbably some arcane quartz in that bag. I also notice that about 200 meters out the dragmarks stop and a vague outline in to trees. two burnt feet near the portal 48 gp and 38 sp id on the male said mario dirochenny. Not his actual name its a company's medallion and its the name of a company that owns the dionchenny trading company which is a continent wide trading company.  also on the other side of the devils ridge and is one of the opposing forces for the trading guild. they are rivals but no active agression. merchant belong to and they are not common.
main theory deliberate attack
Ilona picks up the smell of sulfer and the footmarks are not skeletal but they are imps. 
residuum not good mid portal. 
location of merchants was probbably known. 
portals was probbably to the hells or even a close demiplanes.

wizard has been collecting wayyy to many corpses and has been collecting these for research. 


5 large deer with strange blue things going through their antlers.
Dire-owlbear.  those same veins one of the owlbears across the intire forearms and from the eyes downards.

the owlbear uses the antlers as a powerup. 
down 4 antlers. 

blue owlbear is connected and takes the damage of the deer. 
blue is pulsating
it has bloodfrenzie and two attacks
owlbear can throw you.

Spellburn attacks
Ilona 17 on spellburn effect secondary blast that blackening its thing and did a shit load of damage on the second attack. seemingly no repercussions this will never be changed. minus 6 hitpoints for 6 longrests. I will write this down. 

owlbear dead. blue lines go away. 

when using the ring but someone is watching you. and a spell thread tries to enter my mind. 
5th level spell synaptic static.
you choose a point within range and cause it to explode the create with 8d6 on a failed save. 
an instantaneous spell is hard to trace. but did spot scrying eye.
Lisander is bad so not wife?

owlbear is probbably 
owlbear meat is 5-8 per pound and 10 for direowlbear.
heading back to town. the mudercampsite has remained untouched. going into town 

same male firbolg 
not normal for the elk. take one antler to the barracks and notify dakin and has a green to autum colour Da'kin if not in La'ith got 24 platinum

tre-ent still burning
arriving a group of rangers stretching
female elf later in life long white hair in the celtic knot arcane runes. carrying a large ash-white musket which seems like its grown instead of forged. across there are runes and its probbably musket like. inside the barracks Da'kin. we are called naturekiller. 

4 targeted imp attacks 
vathia. an annoying mage in the area and infects creatures with mind-bending magic. 
a ranger named kim dropped from the rafters and there is an intire second floor.
