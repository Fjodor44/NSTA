# Chained City of Acrol

The Chained City of Acrol is the capital of [[Ostalsia]]. The city is a large city that has been ripped out of the ground and floats 300m above the ground. The only thing preventing the city from rising higher are large shadow-metal chains that chain it to the surface. The city is most known for its export in [[Elemental Airships]], floating vessels using the power of the [[Elemental Planes]] to float and propel. Currently Gestra holds 17 Airships, with a dock in each major capital across the globe.
Acrol is also known for its myth. Legend goes that the city was once located in the [[Feywild]], but through the use of elven magic it escaped. Once the Queen of the [[Shadowfell]] saw the city had escaped she got jealous and chained the city to the material plane with steel deep from within the Shadowfell. This event is rumored to have been the start of the [[War of Twilight]], a 100 year long war between the Shadowfell and the Feywild. The war has officially ended but the bonds between the 2 planes lie forever shattered and the conflict is still being fought in the shadows, being unseen by most.
