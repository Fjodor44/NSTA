# Pricipality of Khatho

Capital: [[Dinez, Nature’s Cradle]] Ruler: [[Lady Di’losar Khatho, Eladrin]]
The Principality of Khatho is another country that grew from a principality into a fully developed nation. The nation is ruled by the original line of rules, the Khatho line. Khatho is ruled as a matriarchy, primarily having a female ruler instead of a male ruler. The country is most known for its lush verdant forest. The country was once a barren deadlands until the [[Pan, God of Nature|pan]] blessed it with his touch. After blessing it at Dinez, a large forest grew out from it and enveloped most of the country.
The country is currently ruled by Lady Di’Losar Khatho, the 4th Eladrin ruler of the nation. Being relatively young for a ruler, she is often seen as inexperienced and has opted to appoint a guidance council, The [[Branches of Khatho]], that helps her rule the nation towards prosperity.
In the north of the country stands a large obelisk known as the [[Silver Mirror]]. the obelisk is made from an otherworldly silver-like metal. The obelisk occasionally thrums with radiant energy. Many adventurers visit the obelisk, as it opens a portal to those powerful enough to conquer its challenge. until now none have returned.
