# Republic of Ne

Capital: [[Qho, Merchant haven]] Ruler: [[The Gilded Council]]
Easily the biggest nation on the map, the Republic of Ne is a country not ruled by 1 ruler. The republic aims for democracy and fair rules to all of its citizens. For this reason the country has a free trade policy, its borders are open to any trader and anyone is allowed to sell. The country is ruled by [[The Gilded Council]], a group of politicians and merchants that steer the country in the direction of prosperity and a good future.
Due to the open policies of the council, the country has become a haven for both adventurers and merchants alike. You can find guilds in every city but none as large as the [[Qho Prosperity Division]], QPD for short. QPD is the largest questing guild in the entire continent and has reach in each country. Most guilds are working under QPD. The guild is not only a questing guild but also a merchant guild, providing pop up store fronts for traveling merchants for low fees and larger buildings for local merchants and artisans.
The country is famed for its [[train line ne]] that goes from east to west. It crosses over the [[Devil’s Ridge]], the thinnest part of the country bridging east to west. It got its name due to the way the ridge originally was created. Long before the Gilded Council was established, [[a Lord]] ruled the country, but he was tempted by [[an Arch Devil]] to betray his country and take in a Fiendish Seed. A group of might heroes stopped his evil plans but during the final clash at Devil’s Ridge, when the swords of the Devil and the Paladin clashed a large amount of mana was released, creating an unfathomably big shockwave, disintegrating a large portion of the land. This area can now be seen on the maps, under the Ridge.
