# Principality of Elolalas

Capital: [[Verin, Nexus Arcanum]] Ruler: [[Lord Zalto Elolalas]], Gold Dragonborn
The Principality of Elolalas is a country that originally started as a principality but has since grown into a fully autonomous country. Being home to the [[UMDA|University of Magical Development & Advancement]], Elolalas is a country dedicated to magical advancement. Many of the great wizards originally come from here, like [[Findar the great]], [[Yggwilv the Witch]] and [[Mordenkeinen]].
The country is ruled by Lord Zalto Elolalas, the last descendant of the original Prince that ruled this country. Zalto himself is not only a ruler but also a scholar, dedicating his studies to his draconic ancestors. He is most notable for writing the [[Draconomicon]], a grimoire that holds all his recorded knowledge of dragons and dragonkind.
In the south of the country lies the dwarven keep of [[Alis-Mor]], a dwarven fortress that has built itself around the arcane quartz vein that runs through it. The quartz vein is speculated to have been created from the proximity to the [[Arcane Leyline]] that runs through the country. Because this quartz is so arcanely potent, it has become the main export of Elolalas.
