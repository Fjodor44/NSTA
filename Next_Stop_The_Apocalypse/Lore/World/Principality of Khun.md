# Principality of Khun
Capital: [[Sighe, Bastion of Advancement]] Ruler: [[Vassal Odana Khun]], Human
To the right of the [[Principality of Khatho]] lies the Principality of Khun. The Principality of Khun started off as a Principality but has since become a Vassal State. It was originally ruled over by a son of the queen of [[Kingdom of Heartia]], Prince [[Starsa Solar]], about 7 generations ago, but the title of ruler has been carried down that line of the family. The country has sworn absolute fealty to the [[Kingdom of Heartia]].
Khun is currently ruled by [[Vassal Odana Khun]]. She is the ruler who has shifted the focus of the country towards [[Clockwork]]. The capital of Sighe is the best example of this effort, as it is dominated by artificer workshops and has many people trying to create 1 goal: fully sentient automatons. The main front of this research is done at [[UMDA MA]].
In the north of the country, near where the country touches both [[Principality of Elolalas|Elolalas]] and [[Republic of Ne|Ne]], there is a mythical dungeon, said to hold the hoard of an ancient dragon long gone. Many adventurers at the guilds talk about wanting to conquer it but nobody has yet to successfully do it.
