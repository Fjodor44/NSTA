# QPD Artisan
QPD Artisan is the department of the [[Qho Prosperity Division|QPD]] that is focused on artisan trades. The purpose of this department is to create a place where anyone can practice their trade and facilitate spaces where they have the opportunity to do so. It also aims to introduce artisans to suppliers within the QPD network so that they can get fair prices on materials.
The department has chapters in all major cities in the [[Republic of Ne]] and is working on having representatives in all smaller towns. The QPD Artisan has a smaller reach compared to the other departments, only having 1 major chapter outside of the Republic, being located in [[Sighe]].
