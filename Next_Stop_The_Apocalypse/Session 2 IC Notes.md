# Session 2 IC Notes

### Ready room
After hearing the plan and the [[Quest nr1]] we discussed how to get more information. After deciding to go to the library, we needed to know how to get access. After calling the clerk asking for more information I once again got confronted with my past. That was not ideal, during this state of shock I spent 2 gold on a drink which then got drunk by [[Lucy]]. Lucy got a bit to drunk and caused a together with [[Enoki]] they burned the roof but I cleaned it a little. It is good to know that [[Squid Ink liquor]] is highly flammable. I need to ask extra clarification on the cups at they seemed invisible.
During this state of drunkenness Lucy managed to piss off the clerk who then cast [[calm emotions]] on us. During this high state I grabbed my student card and got lightning in the face from a version of the glyph of warding spell I apparently cast myself. The envelope was plastered with **DO NOT OPEN** After the lighting blast I got enough sense knocked into me to not open the envelope. 

### Library
The library was [[PLACEHOLDER NAME Library]]
