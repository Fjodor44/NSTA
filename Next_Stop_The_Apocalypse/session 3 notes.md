# session 3 notes
THIS IS SESSION 3 after prologue

the zeitgeist left behind a belt and something?
my arm does emit a magic signal but it does not adhere to a school of magic.
I have zeitgeistbelt
the stone does not like us and the piton shatters into glass shards and nearly kills me
wierd ass magic stone there are non magical effects that do not enhibit magic.
see natural structures in outer planes or specifically crafted by archmages.
its almost like permanent nondetection.
damage reflects back,
healing gets absorbs into the pillar and then turns into ash.
in the ashpile is a shattered version of the crystal and 3 green glasslike shard
this is refined arcane quartz.
these are verden green and not quite residum and the same shit I have in my arm.
Gazalar. hard to refine and usually becomes a mix of more refined and less refined and this is more refined. it has small trails of arcane quarts in there.
galazar blade is the blade that is used to murder me.
I grab the cracked potentiality shard.
Myrthal dreams: unfamiliar memory
Myrthal sitting on a rooftop not alone i am with friend a bald crokscrew horned tiefling purple skin white eyes dressed in magerobes. I am also dressed in magerobes that are unfamiliar but I know they are scolars robes. I am laughing having fun on top of a rooftop. I feel at ease and a sense of calm washes over me. and an intense spark of happyness as a voice goes, tiefling masculin behind me feminen voice behind me gentle and feminen. she calls my name. and I catch a brief glimps of a human women golden blond hair green eyes somewhere in her late 20's this is not a normal human they have something bound to them some spirit is bound to them causing them supernatural abilities and their voice makes me happy I cannot quite make out why. end momory momories of sitting in class fly by magic 101 filled with hope potential and excitment. without any stress. passses. no face is remembered.
