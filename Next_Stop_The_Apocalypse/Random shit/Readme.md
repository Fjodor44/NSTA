# Next Stop: The apocalypse
Welcome to the unofficial wiki for next stop the apocalypse, I know all of you are aching to snoop around and find out wierd connection. Making sure all information is current is quite difficult and I would really like your help with making sure everything up to date. How do I do this you may ask? Well that is quite simple you only need two things Github Desktop and Obsidian.

# Setting up github

First download and install github desktop. 
Download link for Github Desktop:

Once github desktop is installed you can clone the following reposetory by going to file->Clone repository->URL and using the following URL:  https://github.com/Fjodor44/NSTA
You can install it anywhere on your PC but make sure it is a separate folder.

You now have the (nearly) all the files for the obsidian vault you can already start editing but I recommending using obsidian for easier navigation and editing.

# Setting up obsidian

Download and install obsidian from https://obsidian.md
Once installed use open folder as vault and select the folder named "Next_Stop_The_Apocalypse" 
Trust the author to enable the plugins and make obsidian look fancy.
Once this has been done you now have access to the vault in obsidian.

# Keeping things private

Not everyone wants to read everyone's backstory's Mysteries are part of the fun. To keep files secret add a folder called "private" to the folder you selected as vault. Anything put in this folder will not be uploaded but be aware that any new files made are not put into a folder by default. 

# making an update

This is the part I am not sure about and more information will be added at a later date.
