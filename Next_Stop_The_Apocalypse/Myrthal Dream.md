# Myrthal Dream

during my trance I lose control of where it goes. I find myself walking in an empty vally one path grass rolling hills as far as the eye can see. in the distance a mighty citadel walking I am not alone someone is walking withme a small group. one of the group feels closer they feel more like home. a human woman similar to the one from my previous vision but more mature looking my arm already has the crystals. Human woman mid 30's white hair messy at the top into a messy braid of waist lenght simple black cardigan en leather pants and an amulet with a silver disks belt with another silver disk. my walk feels like returning home, the vision shifts to a small little home  standing loose and overgrown garden no more than 4/5 rooms, the house feels like home like belonging also a feeling of fear of secrets, blood on my hands dissapear with a flick of my wrists.
