# Session 3 IC notes (MAJOR SPOILERS)

I do not like gods, what was to be a quick stopover at the [[House of the dead]] has become much more. We met [[Gravekeeper Horic]] to get some holywater, when lucy went to pray I decided why not its been ages. While I do not think I have had any affiliation with the gods before I certainly do not have it now. During this prayer there was a wierd mental pressure unlike anything I have felt before and apparently [[Lucy]] when to the [[Boneyard]] where they saw one of the archangles of [[Kelemvor, God of the Dead|Kelemvor]] and a shitload of imps came out. I personally did not see this but it must have been a scary sight. 

From our perspective it looked like she was illuminated by godly light. In a flash our whole group has been transported to what I am going to call the [[Fate Realm]] everyone was connected with [[Threads of fate]], noteworthy connection points where:
- My right arm
- [[Enoki]]'s mushroom and staff
- [[Hayden]]s echo's seemingly going on infinitly 
- [[Lucy]]s arm bracer
These threads where restraining us and many threads from each one of us came all together. 
There we saw the [[Fate of Foresight, Ryleita]] one of 3 forgotton gods. she told us the following:
> [!quote] Prophecy
> you are all so fragile time has its hands of you, you cannot escape it. beware the future but go now defy fate.

After that we where back in the temple, Horic gave us a short lecture on the [[Planes]] and some information of Ryleita

# Night at the QPD (DO NOT LOOK SPOILERS)
The whole way back to the QPD building the defy fate was echoing in my mind. So when we arrived back at the QPD building I went straight to my room and opened up my student card. Included where 3 things, and letter my UMDA Card and on another small script. 

> [!quote]  The letter

> If you read this… you ignored the warnings You have been used to do terrible things. you will have lost much of your life knowledge-wise and they will be after you. You can still run away from this life or you can face it head on. 
> your arm failed but it paved the way for their new technology. you helped with this technology. 
> They will have stripped you of your arcane power and they will have stripped you of your knowledge. As of this writing you are able to cast 6th level spells. They will have destroyed your spellbook and your ability to cast. If you can cast now, it is of your own will. 
> 
> Run from this life while you can. Figure… find new life. Don’t make my mistake. Defy fate.

> -Myrthal Landir

> [!quote] UMDA Card
> myrthal Iandir hidden devision. hidden is enchanted but will read different for people not me. it has an arcane picture with an even younger version of myrthal. with young features and hope in my eyes. and a ruby teardrop necklace.

And a small note on the inside of the envelope: 'She still loves you'

What does this mean, THE hidden devision? What is that? What have I done who am I? am I still the same person? I need time to think about this. For now I will just run with the group and then I will see what I will do next.  I am so much weaker 

# Travel to the Dungeon

Travel so far is mostly uneventful I really need to look into how Haiden summons his echo's but I will need better supplies and cannot fully persue this on the plains.
On day 5 we encountered an obsidian like Standing stone in which was a crystal.  The stone was made out of [[Ignius Stone]]  and contained a [[Potentiality Shard]] Which contains a spell that I will need to extract in the future.  The ignius stone has radiates the same type of magic that [[Hayden]] does.

Also goblins
