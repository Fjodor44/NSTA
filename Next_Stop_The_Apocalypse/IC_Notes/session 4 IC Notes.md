# session 4 IC Notes

## The goblin fight
Well the encounter with the goblins went to shit quickly. Enoki died and as that happened a voice screamed out and reality seemed to shatter. The goblin warlord got obliterated as the world around him shattered. It is hard to describe but it was almost like glass cracking in 3 dimensions. This sphere seemed to expand continually and become larger and larger.  The fire that the goblins had turned into crystal with Lucy being left outside of the circle. During this time I got a flashback. I did not see much but the same [[Crystal Blade]] that was used on me I used to kill an old man. I did not recognize the old man. While Disturbing it is possible that the spell effecting my memory is not infallible and could either through triggers or other magic be reversed. I need to do more research into this topic. 
Back in the ring of crystal [[Hayden]] seemed to turn into an [[echo]], [[Dew]] lost the ability to fly. [[Myrthal Iandir|my]] arm seemed to be engulfed by purple lightning and [[Enoki]]'s mushroom seemed to start vibrating violently. Around us a ring of shattering reality started to close in on us and fast. Any casting inside seemed to lead to wild and unpredicatble magical effects and as the reality shattered around us the world went dark with the ear-piercing sound of cracking.  And we where back in the QPD tavern. Things might have gone differently if I had used better spells but I was afraid of lighting everything on fire.

## Lisanders ring (spoilers)
During the shattering of reality knowledge about the ring seemed to finally unlock. I assume the ring was made by [[Lisander Galazar]] But who this is I do not know. It is quite powerful giving me power but also allowing Lisander to scry on me every day. This worries me who is this person. Could they be benevolent giving me the ring to stay safe or have they given me this ring for nefarious purposes. I need to try and find more information about these people. could they be a part of the UMDA hidden division? Or are they worse. I need to find some protection against scrying or at least see if I can find out if someone is actively scrying on me.

## QPD tavern
Somehow we ended up back at the qpd tavern. Hayden summons echo's from a dying timeline but because he turned into an echo maybe we where in the dying timeline. 
Our group seemed to be sent back in time to when we just killed the assassin that came to kill me. The sky outside seemed to consist of reds greens and purples almost like northern light. When I cast detect magic cracks seemed to show. These cracks seemed to be void of magic. Outside [[Queen Aira Solar III, The Radiant Queen]] Held a short speech after which she cast a version of calm emotions over the whole city. this is incredibly powerful magic. Because Enoki and I saw the wave of magic coming towards us and because of us not knowing we resisted the effects. Because we where both really stressed out we decided to got to the meeting room where mister Gi was and trigger the calm emotion spell. Mister [[Tsuri Gi]] was quite confused but that does not matter at this point. 
After everything had calmed down [[Enoki]] got called by someone who then quickly used magic to portal over into the room. The sky turned back to normal.
