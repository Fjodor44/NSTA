# Session 5 IC notes
The [[Spirit Weaver]] is a fascinating creature with a clear flair for the dramatic. After her interesting entrance she used some magic on us a spell I did not recognize and declared all our souls fucked due to time travel. Apparently [[Time travel]] leaves scars upon the souls of the people who travel through time.
The [[Spirit Weaver]] Did give us some insight into what has happened. The event which I have named [[The Collapse]] happened due to the planar travel in a dying timeline. When [[Enoki]] died the original spirit weaver made a tear in-between the planes which made things a million times worse and caused the complete collapse and probably the reason that this timeline has felt the impact. I personally do not think this is the right explanation as we have seen with [[Hayden]] that he has a near infinite supply of echo's which come from dying timelines. It cannot be that with all the people that have the ability to planeswalk no one from the dying timeline was planes-walking at the time the timeline was dying. Unless these people have the ability to sense that they are in a dying timeline.

we got more insight into [[Mystra, Goddes of magic]], and got a recommendation to look into [[Darios Tyfon]] which later turned into a quest to meet up with Darios. 

I learned something about myself to. Asking the spirit weaver to look into my modify memory she told me that I was the one that wiped my own memory which is very concerning. Unlocking it can be done through 3 ways. I could die, I can get close to death or using magic everything can be unlocked at once. Apparently the last option is a terrible idea and I will take the spiritweavers word for it. What have I done that I had to wipe my own memory and leave someone behind? Who is Lisander? These are questions that I will need answers to.

During our meeting [[Dew]] Got pulled away in a similar fashion that happened during the original [[The Collapse|Collapes]] but this time a pane of glass appeared behind him which then broke and sucked dew into the time vortex.

we got tasked by the spiritweaver to look up [[Darios Tyfon]] in [[Kashmir]] on the way we will be passing by the obolisk the overgrown aquaduct and 2 towns. the full journey will take about a month to complete.

My trip to the library was unsuccessful as my UMDA card does not work as i had hoped to the hidden division's resources are not as large as I had expected which is good as they do scare me and are one of the main worries right now.
