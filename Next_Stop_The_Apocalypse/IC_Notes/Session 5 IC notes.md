# Session 5 IC notes

So it turns out that [[Listaar]] a large undead problem problem. And since the [[The Collapse]] the undead problem has been getting worse. They have many defences with [[Arcane Ballista]] under the platform next to the staircase. 

After some dillydallying in the tavern we went on the hunt for a quest. First we talked to [[Talia]] Who turned out to be married to [[Puvan]] the local archwizard.  Apparently [[Puvan]] protected the town by teleporting a meteor the size of a house. It got sent to the astral sea. 

[[Talia]]'s house has a staircase with perpetual flames every 10 foot and ofcourse the witch hat above the door.  Talia is the owner of [[Talia's Magic Emporium]]. Talking with Talia we learned that she wanted us to escort her to a nearby grove. For details see [[Tailia's Quest]]

The Emporium was also selling some sparkling healing potions, a ring of protection a cloak of elvenkind a sentinal shield. We also learned that ever since the [[The Collapse]] there is an increase of of abberations also reports of [[Chokers]] and [[Chuul]] also [[corespawn]]. In the Grove which Talia wants us to go to there are [[Bilwis]] apparently they trade with humans. The group decided to do this but wait a day or two to make sure our group is at full strength again. 

Because we have some time before we have to go on Talia's Quest. We decided to do something simple (foreshadowing). So we went to Kitsa's Domain to ask about what needs to be done. [[Kitsa]] Said there is a small pack about a half day south of here of great dear. He would be paying 35 gp per antler. As the antlers can be turned into natural remedies. Kitsa also recommended us to atone for killing the [[Tree-ent]]. We could do this by making an offering to  [[Pan, God of Nature]] or [[Devourer, God of Nature's Wrath]]. 

Going to the Shrines [[Hayden]] told us a story about a follower of Pan named [[Vi]]. The bonfire turned out to be the corpse of a Tree-ent. The rangers who held us at arrowpoint yesterday turned out to be burning the corpse. The head ranger told us to leave an offering I threw my harp into the fire. 

Around the bonfire there are many other shrines to gods such as [[Kelemvor, God of the Dead]][[Mishakal, Goddes of Healing]]. 

During the afternoon I did some extra research into my [[UMDA Student Card]] It turns out it has a layer of illusion on it, but identify has a hard time honing in on the specific nature of the spell. We had some [[Crystal Leaf Moon Tea]] which was very nice. 

During the afternoon we had some time to view the 'undead problem' Which is a little more than a small problem. With  will-o-wisps Blue shades and swordwraiths. There are also commanders. The village is well defended with several arcane ballista's to help defend the entrance. The archwizard should easily be able to take care of this but is probbably using the suffering of this village to farm spell components by only giving enough aid. This seems highly exploitative and honestly if we have the time we should deal with this.
