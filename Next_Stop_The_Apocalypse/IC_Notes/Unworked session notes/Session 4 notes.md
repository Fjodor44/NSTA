# Session 4 notes

the rangers where headed by a large angry woodelf that has a gash of 3 after a quick conversation and showing our qpd credentials they fucked right off
meteorite crashes on day two which seems to be icy cold.

coming closer to the meteor temperature starts to drop. trees are blasted back and frozen. detect magic leaves lingering natural evocation energy similar energy as comes from the elemental planes. 

we got 50 pounds of frost steel ore
frost system
half movement speed
disatvantage on dex skills
disatvanatage on dex checks and savingthrows
-2 to ac and 1/4th movements
the meteorite has ice vaper coming off of it. 
after five poitns you start stacking exaustion.
the meteorite gives of a potent cold energy but it is faint.
it seems to be quite potent and seems to be frost steel a steel that can only be found in meteorites that do not belong to this plane. this happens when the elemental plane of earth and the demiplane of ice crash into eachother. According to Ekoni this is one of the sideproducts of the planes not being aligned propperly. weapons made from frost steel can apply frost to enemies from half movemens to disadvantage on dex skills then saving throws dc and then exaustion. it can also create the bag of cold. Myrthal does not know about anything about this. 
cold auro is about 120 foot and only happens with a massive chunk but it also dispurses the arcane potential energy. chopping it up helps to stop the loss and you have to use a magic refinery. tales speak of anchient magic refineries blessed by the gods. its not commonly used. burried deep in caverns and hollows most if not all have been lost to time. there are 3 in ivria. 
the meteorite is 10/15 meters in diameter.
thermodynamics is a things. and you should not sauna people with hypothermia. 

day 5 we have encountered an illusion lucy steps through an illusion that looks like a tree trunk. 
there was a nondetection spell cast on the chest that lucy got
it fired a lightningbolt
80 gp worth of ink
a ruby worth 50 gp 
and a magic scroll
a lightningbolt scroll
it was a hidden wizard cache.

during my trance I lose control of where it goes. I find myself walking in an empty vally one path grass rolling hills as far as the eye can see. in the distance a mighty citadel walking I am not alone someone is walking withme a small group. one of the group feels closer they feel more like home. a human woman similar to the one from my previous vision but more mature looking my arm already has the crystals. Human woman mid 30's white hair messy at the top into a messy braid of waist lenght simple black cardigan en leather pants and an amulet with a silver disks belt with another silver disk. my walk feels like returning home, the vision shifts to a small little home  standing loose and overgrown garden no more than 4/5 rooms, the house feels like home like belonging also a feeling of fear of secrets, blood on my hands dissapear with a flick of my wrists.

arriving at listaar many guards seem to guard the village. its a small forest village lifted up in the air with wooden platforms lifted in the air. buildings and rope buildings. spirals on the ground act as. in the centere is a massive wooden platform that acts as a trifecta of trees. the path seems to lead to a central final staircase.

a 300 year old spring eladrin walks in called 

Identify on the ore would be frost steel ore
_This blue-ish metal ore is cold to the touch and causes frostbite if handled too long without protection. it is useless in its current raw form_

**Refinement****.** this ore needs to be refined in an arcane refinery, made for exotic materials. When refined it becomes a Frost-Steel Ingot, where it requires 2 pounds of ore to create 1 pound of refined metal.

**Hidden Forges.**Â many tales speak of magical refineries blessed by the gods, lost to time. when identifying this ore with magic, you pull some of these legends into focus through the identify process. you gain the knowledge of the following forge locations;

- a forge lies dormant deep within the hidden halls of a waterways long forgotten and taken by nature
- a forge lies dormant deep within the halls of an ancient fortress in a ravine where magic and crystal meet
	- a forge lies dormant in the sands of a vast desert hidden deep within the temple of an ancient hydra
