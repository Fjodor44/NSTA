ever since the collapse of the multiverse there is an increase of abberations. there were reports of chokers.  mentions of a chuul and specifically report of a corespawn. 

choker would have heard of. 
chuul crab like beast.
corespawn no idea but it could be a classification of abberation similar to starspawn (which I have heard of).
If our group is not complete by tomorrow we should ask the alchemist.
there are bilwis non agro elemental grass elemental based in air. the trading with humans is the non normal part. 
kitsa is located in a large house labeld kitsa's domain its a store .
there is a colour shifting cloak which is similar to the ranges that held us up. behind the counter an older looking firbolg 
its a male firbolg in the later stages of life and probbably had a mohak onces that is now combed over and is turning white. dressed in old timey vest with a chain going to a pocket watch. its a general store and they are looking for great dear antlers. some bonemarrows can be turned into natural remedies there is a small pack half a day south of here. per antler 35 gold pieces. 
we might want to visit the effergy can be a sort of small figurine of prayer but are also often used to worship nature. 

The gold of nature is Pan, the different deity is called the god of natures wrath or the devourer

while making the way north there is a large bonfire

there was an elf named Vi who Hayden travel with which had dedicated their live to pan. they where a bit extreme also missing an arm but had a groot arm which had rooted into their skin. 
at the base of the bonfire its on a stone platform that is being supported by wood with a celtic knot a ring around it and at the four corners it has a hermstone with Pam's head on it and panflutes on it. 
dealing with death and decay corpes of plant based creatures tend to burn longer and this has probbably been burning for a couple of days. 
transport via plants is probbably been used. 

the ranges who held us at gunpoint tells us to cast an offering into the fire.
offerings cast in harp playingcards and 

there is a larger shrine to pan and a shrine to mishacal and a small shrine to kelemvor
kelemvor is the patreon deity for the people who tried to commit suicide.
teaching say its not okay to commit suicide and to help those who are in need. 
the platform near the inn has a skydeck with a railing but there is an open area where you can sit on the edge and look down. 

UMDA card has a transmutation spell on it. and there is a layer of illusion on it. the spell has a hard time honing in on what to call it.

crystal leaf moon tea is the special tea made of the leaves of a crystal poppy which leaves are tranculent and the tea is roselike but sweeter. 
obal coin worth 100gp 

entry platform 40 ft above this platform is 70ft up. and the platform below only 62 foot 

down on the ground are will-o-wisps also known as lost souls remnemts of lost souls that could not pass on. 
three blue shades are moving towards the entrance. alarmbells trigger and guards are rushing towards the entrance. they clash swords with the will-o-wisps and the wraith in the back and murdering the guards. I hear the wurring or arcane energy a bolt of energy is shot out and the willowisp gets obliterated. Magic energy ballista's archwizard. The creates are swordwraiths. they are usually dammed warriors and also they commenly come from mercenaries and bandits whos thirst for death and killing was so great it manifasted into a sword wraith with commanders having the ablilites to summon lesser sword wraiths.  they all have a red dot in them. the commander vanishes. sword wraiths are no fuck around creatures . there are random skeletons roaming around and something here is pulling undead to it. it could be nearly everything. they seemed to be around the town in general. the rangers are harvesting from the murdered swordwraiths. 

Lucy look for desecrated ground 
Mirthal needs to ask the archmade about specifics of undead
its nearly a full moon.

the cart is prtected by a bigger magic circle it cannot be done by an archmage and note a cleric, there wont be big priests in this town. 
the archwizard probbably did not take care of the problem because they wanted undead spell components.
