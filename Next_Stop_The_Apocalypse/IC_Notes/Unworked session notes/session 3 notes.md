# session 3 notes

# House of the dead
[[House of the dead]] long hall and double doors and one room to the right that leads to a back door
grave keeper horik is the temple leader. old gome 3 foot dressed in grey robes. 
main room is a octagonal raised platform with a large altar behind it with a massive statue of [[Kelemvor, God of the Dead]]. benches that look towards the altar behind is the clerical area with prayer benches and more. in the back a set of double doors.  this layout is key defining feature. 
myrthal how do you pray.
there is a mental pressure when praying. this is  the connection to the plane of the dead.
[[Lucy]] gets plucked into the realm of the dead. she is in the boneyard. when the souls die and are not claimed by a god they fade with the restanten being left in the boneyard.
black elven figure dressen in blue robes that is looking over the boneyard that is carrying a greatsword with two large hooks on the tips. this figure is gaust the spineseverer on of the archangels of Kelemvor. NOPE NOPE NOPE. millions of imps get released on the boneyard.
floating in an infinite startscape connected with silver wisps around everything.

Lucy is being illuminated by a beam of light its power seems to be devine. 
I am on an infinite starscape. surrounded by silver strands millions of strings connected to my arm. enokies mushroom is connected. haiden has an infinite amount of cascading haiden echo's. looking up there is a massive masked figure looking down upon us. bonehite with bloodred logo. 6 eyeholes. in each eye socket is a tiny bit of light that feel like an eye. hundrets of voice invade our mind its . 
you are all so fragile time has its hands of you, you cannot escape it. beware the future but go now defy fate.

the silver things where threads of fate. the only time people descibe being tied up where . the symbol dissapears immidiatly.
we have encountered one of the 3 anchient forgotton gods. there where 3 anchient dieties that dicated fate life and reality. we saw the fate of foresieght Ryleita. they are hidden gods with only known their names and quanitity. they do not appear without a reason. 
OC would one of the fates have died. 
they where gods of fate but no more they are anchient they where before and mostlikly be after.  only time will tell. 

name: Fateturners. 

when haiden tries to manifest the echo and it looks exactly the same. 
the glass bottle has an iron cage with glass blown out of it. they are made in a way where the glass is specifically fragile. 
knowledge about these beings is scares. 
knowledge would most likely be found by interacting again or on a different plane of existence. 
planes demiplane of salt collsion between water and earth. 
the plane of earth is just earth
fireplane is just fire 
water waterbreathing. 
outer planes are in the astral plane somewhere in the astral plane is the astral codex the colmination of all knowledge of the multiverse. with names of every devil demon human elf fey. even the names of the gods forgotton dead major minor god adjacent defeated and more. even the smalles of bugs has a place within. 
the plane of the dead is the demiplane. 
only planeswalkers have the knowledge. 
I would be aware of planeshift and familiar with the term plainswalker.
UMDA has speculated to have been started by a planeswalker or astral research. 
romour UMDA was started by an outer planer being. 

THe QPD has the artisans general database.  Which holds the legendary artifact the Open Domain.

  <summary>Spoilers</summary>
  <p>it has an inscription.
if you are reading this 
you come to senses
much you wont remember. 
after opening two things. 
there is a wrapped up card. labled id card. 
piece of parchment. 
dear Myrthal Iandir if you read this, you ignored the warning you have been used to do terrible things. you will have lost much of your life knowledge wise. and they will be after you. you can still run away from this life or you can face it head on. your arm failed but it paved the way for their new technologie. you helped with this technologie. they have stripped you of your arcane power they have stripped you of your knowledge. as of this writing you are able to cast 6th level spells with a destroyed spellbook and your ability to cast. casting now is of your own will. Run from this life while you can. Figure find new life. dont make my mistake. Defy fate. myrthal Iandir hidden devision. hidden is enchanted but will read different for people not me. it has an arcane picture with an even younger version of myrthal. with young features and hope in my eyes. and a ruby teardrop necklace. on the inside of the card.  She still loves you.  written small. </p>

there are two moons a major moon and a minor moon. 
if the moon has the minor moon in front of it it is seen as an ill omen. 

day 2 conversation with Haiden 
day 5 standing stone
there is an engraving on there. 
obsidian glass like stone with a rock. 
this is a blackrock it is a ignius stone that has some of the properties of vulcanic glass for some casters this is used to cast staff crystals from. 

the eye sockets of lucy's bracer have a shit load of magical power. 


it leaves behind a purple crystal that turns translucent white towards the bottom. 

3 pulses enchanting, enchanting, necrotic.

during the calling of the echo there are vague shapes of magic as a string appears pulls thaught and apperates falls on the floor and then an echo rises from the ground. 

task failed sucesfully

level 3 identify 
it takes a while to try to identify, within it there is a spell that is detonating within the crystal giving explading the crystal would have a similar effect.
the spell targets a 10 foot radius and it increases the gravitational pull. within that radius gravity is tripled or quadrupled crushing anything inside of it under their own weight. you can try to extact the spell or turn the crystal into a wand. so it can be turned into a magic item that cast a similar effect. or I can transcribe this. both can fail. 

crystals in spells are normally used in favor of a scroll.

dew has the magic item in their bag of holding.
