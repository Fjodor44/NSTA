# session 4 IC notes

The elven rangers turned out to be an interesting bunch led by [[Da'kin]] a very crumpy woodelf that clearly did not like us killing a tree-ent. Apparently [[Tree-ent]]'s are good creatures. But after showing us they QPD credentials they left and did not return. I feel some shame as I should have remembered that the Tree-ent was good but to be fair we got attacked by an angry tree.

Leaving that behind we continued of air trail getting closer to a meteor. The meteor was made from frost steel ore and seems to be surrounded by traces from the elemental planes. [[Frost Steel Meteor]]. The frost seemed to have interesting effects being harsher than normal cold see [[Frost Effects]]. We also got [[Frost Steel]] one of the many types of elemental infused steel. I nearly killed the whole party after changing the hut to a sauna. Apparently sauna is not a good way to warm up again, the physics do not check out but the apparently this is a biological issue.

On the 5th day of travel we encountered an illusion. After some investigation there was a chest that had a non-detection spell. But they did not listen to my advice and Lucy opened the chest and got a lightning bolt to the face. In the chest there was 80gp worth of ink a ruby (50 gp) and a lightningbolt scroll.

During my trance I had another dream. [[Myrthal Dream]] could it be.... I am not sure.

Finally we arrived at [[Listaar]]. It seems a quint town but apparently it has quite some problems with undead. The archwizard definitly has some interesting things that needs to be done I also think he is quite shady. The local alchamist requested potions.
